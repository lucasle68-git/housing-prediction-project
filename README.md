# Boston Housing Price Prediction

A machine learning project demonstrating end-to-end data analysis and predictive modeling for housing prices using multivariable linear regression.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Boston Housing dataset to build a predictive model for housing prices. The workflow includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding distributions, correlations, and outliers
- **Feature Engineering**: Log transformations for skewed variables, categorical encoding for bimodal features
- **Multicollinearity Treatment**: Identifying and removing highly correlated predictors
- **Model Optimization**: Comparing original vs. transformed models to improve performance

## Dataset Overview

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CRIM** | Per capita crime rate by town |
| **ZN** | Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots |
| **INDUS** | Proportion of non-retail business acres |
| **CHAS** | Charles River proximity (1 = near, 0 = not near) |
| **RM** | Average number of rooms per dwelling |
| **DIS** | Distance to employment centers |
| **RAD** | Accessibility to radial highways |
| **PTRATIO** | Pupil-teacher ratio by town |
| **LSTAT** | Percentage of lower status population |
| **PRICE** | Median home value (target variable) |

**Dataset Size:** 506 observations × 10 features (after preprocessing)

## Key Findings

### Feature Transformations Applied
| Variable | Issue | Solution |
|----------|-------|----------|
| PRICE | Right-skewed | Log transform |
| CRIM | Extreme right-skew | Log transform |
| DIS | Right-skewed | Log transform |
| LSTAT | Right-skewed | Log transform |
| ZN | Zero-inflated (73% = 0) | Binary encoding |
| RAD | Bimodal distribution | Categorical encoding |

### Variables Removed (Multicollinearity)
- **NOX** — Correlated with DIS (-0.77), INDUS (0.76), AGE (0.73)
- **TAX** — Correlated with RAD (0.91)
- **AGE** — Correlated with DIS (-0.75)
- **B** — Removed due to ethical concerns

### Top Price Drivers
| Factor | Impact | Direction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **RM** (Rooms) | ~6.5% per room | ↑ Positive |
| **CHAS** (River proximity) | ~11.1% premium | ↑ Positive |
| **LSTAT** (Lower status %) | ~0.43% per 1% | ↓ Negative |
| **PTRATIO** (Class size) | ~3% per unit | ↓ Negative |

## Model Performance

### Comparison: Original vs. Transformed Model

| Metric | Original Model | Transformed Model | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **R² (Train)** | 0.712 | 0.730 | +2.5% |
| **R² (Test)** | 0.706 | 0.754 | +6.8% |
| **RMSE (Train)** | 4.886 | 0.210* | — |
| **RMSE (Test)** | 5.100 | 0.203* | — |

*RMSE in log units (not directly comparable to original)

### Key Improvements
✅ **Better generalization**: Test R² improved from 0.706 to 0.754  
✅ **Reduced heteroscedasticity**: More uniform residual distribution  
✅ **Improved high-value predictions**: Less underprediction at price ceiling
